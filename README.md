# shiny-covariance-quiz

Shiny app quiz on covariance matrices.

The app randomly generates a positive-definite 4x4 matrix and asks the user three questions:

- What is the correlation between variable A and B?
- What is the covariance between A and C?
- What is the (standard deviation or variance) of D?

The numbers are generated to make the computations easy.
